How much of my donation goes to helping others?,We are committed to using donations responsibly to create the greatest possible impact. In the past year, 85% of all donations were used for charitable activities, including running programs that directly support individuals and communities in need, as well as advocacy and awareness campaigns. The remaining 15% was invested in fundraising efforts to ensure the sustainability of our mission.
How are donations spent?,Your donations are allocated to essential programs and services that aim to address both immediate needs and long-term development goals. This includes emergency response work, education initiatives, healthcare projects, and advocacy efforts. The majority of funds directly support these programs, while a portion is allocated to raising additional funds to expand our reach and impact. Through these efforts, we ensure that your contributions create meaningful change and benefit as many people as possible.
How will I know my donation is making a difference?,We believe in transparency and keeping our supporters informed. Each year, we publish an annual report detailing how donations were spent and the impact they achieved. Additionally, if you are sponsoring a child, you will receive a Child Progress Report from the local organization working directly with the child and their family, providing updates on their health, education, and overall well-being. Your sponsored child may also write to you ― and we hope you'll write back! These personal updates, along with our regular newsletter, will help you see how your contributions are making a tangible difference. If you have specific questions, our Support Team is always available to assist you.
What tangible benefits do the recipients of your programs receive?,The people we support gain access to essential resources such as healthcare, education, and safe living environments. For example, children can attend school instead of being forced into labor, families can access clean water and nutritious food, and communities can build safer and healthier futures. These tangible outcomes are a direct result of your generous donations and our collective efforts to create lasting change.
Can I send a gift to the children you support?,Yes, you are welcome to send small and thoughtful gifts to the children we support. To ensure fairness and efficiency, we ask that your package weigh no more than 150g and fit into an A4 envelope with a thickness of no more than 5cm. For example, a deck of cards is a good reference for the maximum weight. Items such as writing and drawing tools, including pens, pencils, crayons, small notebooks, and erasers, are appropriate. Tokens of friendship, like photos, stickers, ribbons, and inexpensive bracelets, are also suitable, as are educational materials such as small puzzles, coloring books, or travel-sized board games. However, due to international guidelines, we cannot accept items like money, food, liquids, fragile objects, clothes, or battery-operated items. Gifts should be sent to the following address: Virtual Charity, 123 Hope Lane, London, WC1A 1AA, United Kingdom. Please include your sponsor number and the child’s reference number to ensure accurate delivery. If the package exceeds the specified size or weight, we regret that we will not be able to forward it. Thank you for understanding, and we encourage you to keep your package light and meaningful.
Can I send monetary gifts for special occasions?,Yes, monetary gifts are a wonderful way to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or significant achievements in a child’s life. You can send a monetary gift through your online sponsorship account, include it with your sponsorship donations using the Sponsorship Reply form, or contact our Support Team at +44 20 1234 5678 for assistance. We recommend sending monetary gifts at least two months in advance to ensure they arrive on time for special occasions. The suggested amount ranges from $20 to $50, and the entirety of your gift will be delivered to the child and their family in local currency. To assist with delivery and processing, we kindly ask for an additional $3.50 handling fee. Once the gift has been delivered, our local staff will confirm its receipt and notify you of the amount received. Your support makes a meaningful difference, and we deeply appreciate your generosity.
